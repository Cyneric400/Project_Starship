If you're here, you're probably in a near death situation. Note: Panicking is NOT advised.
The 'nav_sys_control' follows the layout listed below in order to work correctly.

nav_sys_control
    flight_paths
        break_orbit
        default
        orbit
    pulsar_compass

Use the following commands to make the filesystem match the layout above:
  touch <file> - create a new file
  mv <old> <new> - move or rename a file
  cp <old> <new> - copy a file and give the copy a name
  rm <file> - remove a file
  rmdir <directory> - remove a directory
  <command> >> <file> - appends the output of a command to a specified file
  nano <file> - opens the specified file in the "nano" text editor

Tips:
  break_orbit must be a copy of default. The content in the two files must be the same for the nav system to properly load.
  pulsar_compass must contain the line "compass.init".
  Any other files are likely to be corrupted and unusable. Delete if necessary.

Have fun and don't die!
